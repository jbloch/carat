# This nasty little file is necessary to make the launcher (carat.bat) work properly on Windows. Without it,

# which is necessary to make the mac launcher executable (due to deficiencies in the Windows file system).
# Isn't software fun?

# Default behavior: normalize line endings to LF in the repo, check out as LF
* text=auto eol=lf

# Force Windows batch scripts to ALWAYS check out with CRLF (\r\n)
*.bat text eol=crlf

# Force macOS/Linux scripts to ALWAYS check out with LF (\n)
*.command text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
